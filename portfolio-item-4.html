            <strong>Summary:</strong> PartyfundMe harnesses inspiration from my
            past mobile app, MoneyShot. MoneyShot threw birthday parties at
            local bars in the bay area to generate awareness of the app. The
            guest of honor was promoted on a flyer, asking guests to attend. If
            a guest could not participate in the event, the option to send the
            birthday boy/girl a drink in their absence was made available. In
            addition, the guest of honor's network used their social media to
            promote the event. A side effect was the birthday boy/girl received
            more drinks than they could drink that night. The guest of honor
            used the excess credits to create an open bar for all guests
            attending. MoneyShot went on to throw multiple events that users
            crowdfunded.
          </p>
          <p>
            PartyFundMe was my attempt at recreating this concept at the
            beginning of my coding journey. I experimented using Python, Flask,
            PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, and the Stripe API, which I was familiar
            with because of MoneyShot.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Flask framework allowed for an out-of-the-box web server setup
            abstracting many low-level details that helped speed up web
            application development. The Jinja template engine allowed for easy
            implementation of HTML and Python code and logic within my template
            pages.
          </p>

          <hr />
          <p>
            <strong>Flask-Blueprints: </strong> helped create reusable instances
            of the application. It also provided organization in the form of
            projects in modules.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Flask-Admin: </strong> Was used to create a GUI Admin panel
            for a more effortless user experience for admins to have CRUD
            capabilities with the events, bars, and users.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Flask-login: </strong> provided user session management for
            Flask. It handles the everyday tasks of logging in, logging out, and
            remembering your users' sessions over extended periods.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Flask-Bcrypt: </strong> a Flask extension that provides
            bcrypt hashing utilities for the application. Users' passwords were
            encrypted using Bcrypt, and a hash was stored on the back end,
            ensuring sensitive data is kept safe.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>PostgreSQL: </strong> was chosen for this project because of
            its popularity as the primary data store or data warehouse for many
            web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications. PartyFundMe
            used a basic schema to create relationships and store the back-end
            users, user profile data, event data, and bars.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Stripe-API: </strong> was used so users could buy tickets
            for events online with a credit card. For example, a user would
            purchase an event and then receive confirmation through Flask-Mail.
            After verification, the total money raised reflects the event's
            purchase, and the user profile picture of who bought the event shows
            up in the RSVP section.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What I learned: </strong> Taking on this concept was my
            first solo attempt at developing a full-stack project. It was
            overwhelming at times due to wanting to add so much functionality
            out of the gate. The project became a playground to test my
            knowledge learned through the Springboard Software Engineering
            Bootcamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoyed the user authentication/authorization on both the
            front-end and back-end sides. I had more fun setting up the back-end
            routes and the database compared to the front-end design. I was
            happy with the implementation of Flask-Blueprints. By taking on the
            project from a modular approach, I feel it will be much easier when
            I come back to the project and want to add or remove functionality.
